Exercise - 3
*** take 5 numbers and find avg and sum***
Start
step 1 : Accept the first number and store it in a variable "num1".
step 2 : Accept the second number and store it in a variable "num2".
step 3 :Accept the third number and store it in a variable "num3".
step 4 :Accept the fourth number and store it in a variable "num4".
step 5 :Accept the fifth number and store it in a variable "num5".
step 6 :Calculate the sum of all the numbers by adding them together, and store the result in a variable "total".
step 7 :Calculate the average of the numbers by dividing the total by 5, and store the result in a variable "average".
step 8 :Display the value of "total" and "average".

Exercise - 4
***take a number and find it odd or even***
step 1 :Start
step 2 :Accept a number as input and store it in a variable "num".
step 3 :Divide the number by 2 and check the remainder. If the remainder is 0, the number is even. If the remainder is 1, the number is odd.
step 4 :If the remainder is 0, display a message "The number is even".
step 5 :If the remainder is 1, display a message "The number is odd".
step 6 :Stop.

Exercise - 5
*** algorithm for taking two numbers and displaying greatest number***
step 1 :Start
step 2 :Declare 2 numbers "a" and "b"
step 3 :If "a" is greater than "b", display "a" as the greatest number
step 4 :If "b" is greater than "a", display "b" as the greatest number
step 5 :If "a" is equal to "b", display "Both numbers are equal"
step 6 :Stop.

step 1 :Start
step 2 :Declare the variable as character
step 3 :take input from user 
step 4 :If the character is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u', display "The character is a vowel."
step 5 :Otherwise, display "The character is a consonant."
step 6 :stop

Displaying Highest of three numbers
step 1: start
step 2: Declare three numbers as num1, num2, num3(to read input from user)
step 3: check if num1 is greater than num 2
step 4: if true, check if num1 is greater than num3.
             3.1 if true, print num1 is the greatest number
             3.2 if false, print num3 is the greatest number
step 5: if false, then check num2 is greater than num3
             4.1 if true, print num2 as greatest number
             4.2 if false, print num3 as the greatest number
step 6: stop.
